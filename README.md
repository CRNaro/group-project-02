## Description
    Wet My Plants is a website for plant lovers and haters alike to go for all their houseplant information. If you have pets, difficulty keeping your plants alive, or just want to know about more plants to add to your collection; this website is for you. Once you enter in the name of a plant you wish to know more about, you will get more informaton regarding the care and information about that plant. This information includes a description of the plant, what type of watering and sunlight the plant needs, if the plant is toxic to your pets and a picture of the plant.

## Installation
  Since this application is deployed to Heroku, no installation is needed on the users side.

## Usage
  This website is meant to be used to gain more knowledge about your favorite houseplants. Once you enter a plant name, information is pulled from a third-party API (Perenual) that is then displayed to the user. From here, the user may save this plant to their list of plants if they wish. When they click save, the information that is pulled from Perenual, gets added to a database housed on the user's server so that it can be accessed again in the future. Should the user find that they no longer need a certain plant on their list, they can choose to delete that plant from the database.
